        <p class="text-white mb-3">
          Tarot cards began as a card game, not a tool for fortune-telling. The
          earliest known tarot decks appeared in northern Italy in the 15th
          century, where they were used for a trick-taking game called tarocchi.
          These decks featured richly illustrated cards depicting figures,
          symbols, and scenes drawn from everyday life, religion, and classical
          ideas of virtue, fate, and power.

        <p class="text-white mb-3">
          Over time, tarot took on new meanings. By the 18th and 19th centuries,
          scholars and mystics in Europe began interpreting the cards
          symbolically rather than recreationally. Tarot became associated with
          philosophy, psychology, and spiritual reflection, shaped by influences
          ranging from Renaissance humanism to modern depth psychology. What had
          once been a game evolved into a visual language for exploring
          patterns, questions, and inner states.

          A traditional tarot deck contains 78 cards divided into two parts: the
          Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana consists of 22
          cards that represent archetypal experiences — transformation, choice,
          loss, growth, and change. The Minor Arcana contains 56 cards divided
          into four suits, reflecting the rhythms and challenges of everyday
          life. Together, the cards form a system that blends structure with
          interpretation.

          Today, tarot is used in many ways. Some people approach it as a
          spiritual or divinatory practice, others as a creative or
          psychological tool, and many simply appreciate the art, symbolism, and
          history behind the cards. Tarot does not provide fixed answers or
          predictions; instead, it offers a framework for reflection — a way of
          thinking through uncertainty, intention, and perspective.

        <p class="text-white mb-3">
          At its core, tarot is a conversation between symbols and the person
          engaging with them. Whether approached as history, art, ritual, or
          personal inquiry, tarot continues to evolve, shaped by the questions
          we bring to it.
