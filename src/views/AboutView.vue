        <h1>About The Tarot</h1>
        <p>Tarot cards began as a card game, not a tool for fortune-telling. The earliest known tarot decks appeared in northern Italy in the 15th century, where they were used for a trick-taking game called tarocchi. These decks featured richly illustrated cards depicting figures, symbols, and scenes drawn from everyday life, religion, and classical ideas of virtue, fate, and power.</p>
        <p>Over time, tarot took on new meanings. By the 18th and 19th centuries, scholars and mystics in Europe began interpreting the cards symbolically rather than recreationally. Tarot became associated with philosophy, psychology, and spiritual reflection, shaped by influences ranging from Renaissance humanism to modern depth psychology. What had once been a game evolved into a visual language for exploring patterns, questions, and inner states.</p>

        <p>A traditional tarot deck contains 78 cards divided into two parts: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards that represent archetypal experiences — transformation, choice, loss, growth, and change. The Minor Arcana contains 56 cards divided into four suits, reflecting the rhythms and challenges of everyday life. Together, the cards form a system that blends structure with interpretation.</p>
        <p>Today, tarot is used in many ways. Some people approach it as a spiritual or divinatory practice, others as a creative or psychological tool, and many simply appreciate the art, symbolism, and history behind the cards. Tarot does not provide fixed answers or predictions; instead, it offers a framework for reflection — a way of thinking through uncertainty, intention, and perspective.</p>
        <p>At its core, tarot is a conversation between symbols and the person engaging with them. Whether approached as history, art, ritual, or personal inquiry, tarot continues to evolve, shaped by the questions we bring to it.</p>
